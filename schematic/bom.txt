Bill of materials:

1 Arduino Nano (or suitable microprocessor)
1 Adafruit VL53L0X Time of Flight sensor
3 5v relay boards (to control red, yellow and green lights)
4 2 position screw terminals (power connections)
1 3 pin header (relay triggers to red, yellow, green lights)
2 2 pin headers (sensor)
2 PC Boards to mount the components on

For the red, yellow, green lights you may use anything you can dream up.  Originally I had LEDs
in the plan, but found a small traffic light desk lamp for sale on eBay and used that with
relays to trigger the lights.  If you use LEDs, you can skip the relays and use transistors to 
trigger clusters of LEDs.
