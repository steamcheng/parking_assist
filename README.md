# Garage Parking Assistant


The project uses an Arduino Nano and a VL53L0X time of flight sensor to hel allow parking a car in a small garage area.  I use my garage as a workshop too, and encroachment has shortened my parking spot a bit.  I have the classic analog tennis ball on a string assistant there now, but wanted to get rid of it, since i run into it when working on something in the empty parking spot.  Also, because I can.

The concept is simple: a sensor determines how far away the car is, and the processor turns on some lights to provide feedback to the driver.  I bought a small, plastic stoplight lamp off eBay and rewired it for my purpose.

I have included a schematic along with the fritzing file that I used to generate it. Also included is a bill of materials.
